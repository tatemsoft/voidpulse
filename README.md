This project is in private beta as I iron out the bugs.

We are currently using this in production for the [Voidpet app](https://voidpet.com).

I don't want to pay $40k for analytics.

# Techstack

- React/Typescript/Next.js
- Node.js with TRPC & Drizzle ORM
- Postgresql
- Clickhouse (for storing/querying events)
